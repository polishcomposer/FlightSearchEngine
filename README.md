**Functionality**

The project was developed using ASP.NET MVC. The main functionality of the application is to search for one-way and return flights using various filters: number of passengers, cabin class, and number of transfers. The search engine also allows displaying prices in the currency selected by the user. The application also has a UI in which, after registration, the user can save the flights he has searched for. Additional functionality of the application is the ability to check the latest COVID-19 information in the country selected by the user.
